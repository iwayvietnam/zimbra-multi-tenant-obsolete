<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<hr>
List FQA:<br />
<br>
<h3> How does the ZaaS run?</h3>
<hr>
It will explain how the ZaaS run.<br />
First, You need install and config ( copy a phpchecker file to Zimbra server, set crontab (scheduling) to run this php file.<br />
You need to configurate some settings: Address Zimbra, own IP, and password key for transaction.<br />
Next, You have to install Drupal CMS (if you have not install already), Install Module: zaasmhst and enable it. <br />
After that, create new roles and assign new permission to your users ( which have suffix name is domain name, for example : admin@zaasmhst.com.
When done, Create new server connection with IP, passkey is same in your Zimbra server.
<br /><b>When you create a command to Zimbra service, It takes some time to get from Drupal CMS and execute it.  </b>
<br /><font color=red>Your created command is saved in Database of Drupal CMS. Schedulerly, Zimbra server will connect to Zimbra server to get command.</font>
<br />
<h3> How about other ways to execute commands?</h3>
<hr>
<br /> Of cause, We have another way to execute commands.
<br /> There are 2 way to execute: run indirectly (like this version) and run directly. So what is "run directly"? It means that the command you created is executed immediately by Zimbra server.
<br />By that way, Drupal needs to contact directly to Zimbra Server, and sends the command to it. So you nearly need not time for waiting. But what about its disadvantages?
<br />First, If you have some mistake in commands, you can not delay or pause.
<br />
<h3> How many type (roles) Users and what can I do with those roles?</h3>
<hr>
<br />This tool uses 3 Roles to control. There are: Super Admin (highest permission), Tenant and Domain manager.
<br />Super Admin: is user can control the system, create/stop Connections between Drupal and Zimbra server. Often this user is root account of Drupal CMS. He can assign domains management to Tenants.
<br />Tenant: is higher permission. This user can only create Domain managers which belong to his domain(s). And he can manage all mailbox, alias, group which domain he assigned.
<br />Domain manager: is base user. He only manage ONE domain which belong to him, no more. He can create Mailbox, Alias and Group.
<br />
<br />
<h3> What is different User Accounts between Drupal and Zimbra server?</h3>
<hr>
<br />You will see there is no relationship between Drupal and Zimbra server. You must create 2 account in same time. But according to notion, You should create Drupal user account is same user in Zimbra server (the mailbox name - email).
<br />

<h3> Must I create new Drupal user account in form like email - @company.com ?</h3>
<hr>
<br />As I said before, In notion, you should create new Drupal user account in form like Zimbra - email form such as user1@company.com
It is easy to read comprehensiblely and manage. You would know who is he, where he belongs.
Of cause, You can create a normal account name, none email form.
